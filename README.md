# Stock Analysis with VBA

The objective is to create a script that will loop through a large dataset of stock values and return a consolidated list of each individual stock being tracked along with the total volume of that stock over the period.

The script will also display the yearly change the stock experienced in both raw amount and as a percentage of the total volume, and color code the value green for a positive change and red for a negative change.

Finally, the script will create a small table that returns the stocks with the largest percentage increase, percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
